## Project Overview
This portfolio acts as a testament to my accomplishments in web development. Built with HTML, CSS, Sass, Bootstrap, and a sprinkle of JavaScript, it underscores the skills I've honed during the HackerU Fullstack Development course.

## Features
1. **Responsive Design**: Offers a pleasing experience across desktop and mobile devices.
*(Please note that the performance on tablets and wide-screen displays hasn't been tested. These will be optimized in upcoming versions.)*
2. **Modern UI**: The design emphasizes user-friendliness with a consistently modern theme throughout.
3. **6 Showcase Projects**: A showcase of six distinct landing pages created with HTML, CSS, and Sass, providing insights into my design and development capabilities.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Forms the fundamental structure of the content.
- **CSS & Sass**: Employs Sass for efficient, modular CSS styling.
- **Bootstrap**: Facilitates rapid development and design consistency.
- **JavaScript**: Powers the responsive mobile menu, ensuring a smoother mobile experience.
